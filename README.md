Implementing a basic neural network from scratch and comparing it with Scikit-Learn's MLP Classifier.

Code plots loss curve comparing the time taken by each method. Scikit-learn beats hard-coded implementation comfortably.

Imp parameters:
1. Sigmoid activation function
2. One input layer
3. One hidden layer with two neurons
4. One output layer
